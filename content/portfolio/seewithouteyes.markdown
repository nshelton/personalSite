## *THE FILM*

[Strangeloop Studios](https://www.strangeloop-studios.com/) created a 50 minute film to accompany the entire album. This gave us plenty of reference. We also shared assets and they actually rendered some sequences from the film in Unity, giving us a decent starting point. 

## *VR SCREENSHOTS*

We ended up getting several songs chopped into to shorter mixes, and created several scenes. Some were solitary experiences, and others were multiplayer. All scenes had some sort of interactivity.
