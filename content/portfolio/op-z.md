Unity Visuals pack for OP-Z multimedia synthesizer
<!--more-->
[Project on Github](https://github.com/nshelton/op-z1.1)

I've been working with [Teenage Engineering](https://www.teenageengineering.com/) on a videopak for their newest synthesizer. It connects to an iOS devide and can control visuals in Unity through MIDI over Bluetooth! Pretty slick.
This should eventually get released on some kind of official videopak marketplace thing. In the meantime you can download and install from [here](https://github.com/nshelton/op-z1.1/releases)
