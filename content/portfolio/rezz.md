Beyond the Senses EP release

# What is a Virtual Concert?

This was the first big show we did using the new *Wave Studio* tech stack I designed.  This includes:
 - [Xsens](https://www.xsens.com) Mocap Suit
 - [ManusVR](https://manus-vr.com/) gloves
 - [ARKit Face Tracking](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/tracking_and_visualizing_faces)
 - Pioneer CDJs and Mixer
 - Bunch of projectors and TVs
 - An bunch of *wires*
 - The Wave crunching all this data in realtime in Unity
 
 We Stream this out to multiple online video streaming services, like *Twitch*, *Youtube*, *Facebook*, *Periscope* etc...
 
 But also stream this into the *Wave* VR and desktop clients where you can go and watch the show on your computer at home and see all the animation and audio data coming through

 We've built a custom *Camera Man* build that can do realtime HD renders and crossfading, without the VR or desktop controls. We can use an *XBox controller* to fly the drone cam! Or have prebuilt camera animations. 

 And obviously we're triggering all the visuals Live over *MIDI* (at least the stuff that's not *audioreactive*)

Here's the stream (skip to 20 min in):

The cool thing about this tech is that it's all realtime, so you could, say, create a music video pretty easily! Here we had our Artist [Daniel Sierra](http://optical-rhythm.com/) Live VJing, and the venerable [Strangeloop](https://strangeloop-studios.com/) was flying the Drone cam! It's the future of digital collaboration! Of course then the guys at Strangeloop Studios did a sick edit and threw in some more goodies.

# Behind the scenes
It was very hot, LA in the middle of the summer and we have this tiny office. And when we have all the GPUs and sound system running there isn't enough power left for the AC to actually work.

Here I am looking intensely at some very important performance information probably relating to *bits per second*.

*Aaron Lemke* is in the zone manning the cameraman build. Note the 2 keyboards for double hacking.

We got this cad model of the actual stage setup REZZ would use in her tour! So we put it into Unity and hooked up lights and video walls! I hope somebody goes to her show and thinks, for some reason this looks familiar....
