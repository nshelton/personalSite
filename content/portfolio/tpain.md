T-Pain's School of Business feature at The Wave
<!--more-->
# The first demo

*Wave's* new VR motion capture studio was featured on an episode of *T-Pain's School of Business* show which was pretty cool. I got to put a Mocap suit on Tpain. He is a funny guy.

This is the first time we actually showed this crazy stuff to outside people, but we didn't set it up for full on broadcast and streaming (because we were still building that part). To see the first big broadcast, check out [REZZ - Beyond the senses]({{site.baseurl}}{%link _posts/2019-06-23-rezz.markdown%}).
