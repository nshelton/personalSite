Audio-reactive LED wall Installation with Alex Stickels. Shown at 'The Art of Dying' at The Laundry SF
<!--more-->

Using LightJams, programmed a friend's LED wall to be audio reactive to an original orchestral composition. The viewer put on a SubPac and headphones, along with the lightshow it made for a pertty immersive experience! The score had a huge crescendo, which, along with the lights and SubPac shaking your body made for a pretty epic finale.

It was actually set up to do a wave simulation, with audio frequencies feeding the center of a ripple. Due to time constraints I couldn't get the array to map the LEDs properly, so it'd got this weird interlaced offset thing.
