      <description>Realtime VR Fractal Sandbox
Ṛta is the principle of natural order which regulates and coordinates the operation of the universe and everything within it. In the hymns of the Vedas, Ṛta is described as that which is ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the natural, moral and sacrificial orders.

      <description>Live performance at 3D web fest
Music by Alon Mor
This fractal visualization explores the relationship between chaos and rules. Given simple objects and processes, iteration yields an unprecedented network of connections and complexity. All parameters controls can be changed on the fly, with 3D controls. This is a fundamental property of all organisms around us. Simple cells follow iterative processes, generating the richness in forms of the natural world. This work illustrates these connections with a powerful 3D fractal renderer capable of visualizing complex networks from tree structures to immersive surreal landscapes.</description>

      <description>Mobile fractal visualizer
Towards realtime mobile raytracing This was an experiment, after using SceneKit for the Bridge Engine at Occipital in iOS, to see what I could do with solely a SCNTechnique, full-frame shader. I was really inspired by this talk by Tim Lottes about filtering methods for realtime raymarching. What kind of quality could be achieved on an iPhone6 ?
Render Loop I didn&amp;rsquo;t implement all of the crazy stuff he mentions within the SCNTechnique, but a few were easy to do:</description>
